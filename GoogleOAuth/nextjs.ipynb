    "   - **Name:** Enter a name for the credentials (e.g., \"NextAuth App\").\n",
    "   - **Authorized JavaScript Origins:**\n",
    "     - Add the base URL of your Next.js app (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for local development).\n",

    "The URL `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` is used as the **Redirect URI** for Google OAuth authentication. Here's why this specific URL is needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Role of Redirect URI in OAuth**\n",
    "- When a user logs in via Google, they are redirected to Google's login page.\n",
    "- After the user grants or denies permission, Google sends them back to your application via the **Redirect URI**.\n",
    "- This URI is where Google sends the authentication code or token, allowing your app to complete the login process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Why `api/auth/callback/google`?**\n",
    "- `NextAuth` handles the OAuth flow for you.\n",
    "- The endpoint `api/auth/callback/google` is a pre-defined route in `NextAuth` where the authentication response from Google is processed.\n",
    "- It uses this endpoint to:\n",
    "  - Exchange the authorization code for an access token.\n",
    "  - Validate the user's identity.\n",
    "  - Establish the user session.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Local Development vs. Production**\n",
    "- **Local Development:**\n",
    "  - When running locally, the callback URL will typically be `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`.\n",
    "  - This is specified in the Google Cloud Console under **Authorized Redirect URIs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Production:**\n",
    "  - When you deploy your app, the callback URL changes to match your domain. For example:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    https://your-production-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - You need to add this production URL to **Authorized Redirect URIs** in the Google Cloud Console.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Why is it part of the `api` directory?**\n",
    "- In Next.js, all files inside the `pages/api/` directory are treated as API routes.\n",
    "- `NextAuth` defines and manages the `/api/auth` routes for handling authentication, including the callback logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. How It Works in the Authentication Flow**\n",
    "1. User clicks **Sign In** in your app.\n",
    "2. The app redirects the user to Google's login page.\n",
    "3. After login, Google redirects back to the `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` endpoint.\n",
    "4. `NextAuth` processes the response from Google, retrieves the access token, and sets up the user session.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flow ensures secure and seamless integration with Google's OAuth 2.0 system."
