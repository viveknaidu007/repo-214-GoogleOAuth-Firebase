    "In a React.js application (not using Next.js), the authentication flow with Google OAuth will follow similar principles, but the implementation differs because React lacks built-in API routing like Next.js. Here's how you can achieve it:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps for Google OAuth in React.js**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up Google Cloud Project**\n",
    "   - Follow the same steps as in Next.js:\n",
    "     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n",
    "     - Create a project and enable the \"Google Identity Services\" API.\n",
    "     - Configure the OAuth consent screen.\n",
    "     - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials.\n",
    "   - Add `http://localhost:3000` as the **Authorized JavaScript Origin** (since React uses client-side routing).\n",
    "   - Add a **Redirect URI**, such as `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use a Backend for Secure Token Exchange**\n",
    "   - React is a front-end library and cannot securely handle secrets like the `CLIENT_SECRET`. You need a backend to:\n",
    "     - Securely store `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.\n",
    "     - Handle the OAuth flow and token exchange with Google's servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Common backends for this purpose include:\n",
    "   - Express.js\n",
    "   - Django/Flask\n",
    "   - Node.js with libraries like `passport-google-oauth20`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Authentication Flow**\n",
    "   - When using React, the flow usually involves:\n",
    "     1. **Frontend (React):**\n",
    "        - User clicks the \"Sign in with Google\" button.\n",
    "        - Redirect the user to Google’s OAuth login page.\n",
    "     2. **Google Redirect:**\n",
    "        - After login, Google redirects the user to a predefined **Redirect URI**, e.g., `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`.\n",
    "     3. **Backend (Node.js/Express):**\n",
    "        - The backend receives the authorization code from the callback.\n",
    "        - Exchanges the code for an access token using the `CLIENT_SECRET` on the server side.\n",
    "        - Sends the access token or user data back to the frontend.\n",
    "     4. **Frontend (React):**\n",
    "        - Stores user data (or token) in a secure way (e.g., Context API, Redux).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **React Code Example Using Google Identity Services**\n",
    "If you want a fully client-side solution (e.g., using the Google Identity Services SDK):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Frontend-Only Implementation (Not Secure for Production)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the Google Identity Services SDK:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install @react-oauth/google\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following code in your React component:\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "import React from \"react\";\n",
    "import { GoogleLogin } from \"@react-oauth/google\";\n",
    "\n",
    "function Login() {\n",
    "  const handleLogin = (response) => {\n",
    "    console.log(\"Google Token:\", response.credential);\n",
    "    // Send the token to your backend for further processing (securely handle user data).\n",
    "  };\n",
    "\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div className=\"login-container\">\n",
    "      <h1>Login with Google</h1>\n",
    "      <GoogleLogin\n",
    "        onSuccess={handleLogin}\n",
    "        onError={() => {\n",
    "          console.log(\"Login Failed\");\n",
    "        }}\n",
    "      />\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "export default Login;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps in Backend for Secure Token Handling**\n",
    "1. Receive the `response.credential` (JWT token) from the frontend.\n",
    "2. Verify the token using Google’s `oauth2/v3/tokeninfo` API or a library like `google-auth-library`.\n",
    "3. Store the authenticated user’s details in your database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Redirect URI in React**\n",
    "For React, the **Redirect URI** will typically be `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`. However:\n",
    "- If you use a backend for token exchange, the **Redirect URI** will point to your backend endpoint, e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback`.\n",
