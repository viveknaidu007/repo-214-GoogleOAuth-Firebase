    "### **1. Development Testing (with Test Ads)**\n",
    "- **What you see:** “Test Ad” label on all ads.\n",
    "- **How it works:**  \n",
    "  - The code uses `__DEV__` to detect development mode and uses Google’s test ad unit IDs.\n",
    "  - This is safe and recommended for all development and debugging.\n",
    "- **How to run:**\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  npx react-native run-android\n",
    "  # or\n",
    "  npx react-native run-ios\n",

    "### **2. Production Testing (with Real Ads)**\n",
    "- **What you see:** Real ads from AdMob (no “Test Ad” label).\n",
    "- **How it works:**  \n",
    "  - When you build a release (production) version, `__DEV__` is false, so your real Ad Unit IDs are used.\n",
    "  - **Important:** You should add your device as a test device in AdMob to avoid accidental clicks on real ads during testing.\n",
    "- **How to run:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **For Android:**\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "cd android\n",
    "./gradlew assembleRelease\n",
    "# or from project root\n",
    "npx react-native run-android --variant=release\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Install the generated APK on your device.\n",

    "#### **For iOS:**\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "cd ios\n",
    "pod install\n",
    "cd ..\n",
    "npx react-native run-ios --configuration Release\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Or archive and install via Xcode for a true production test.\n",

    "### **3. Best Practices for Production Testing**\n",
    "- **Register your device as a test device** in AdMob to avoid policy violations.\n",
    "- **Never click on your own real ads** during production testing.\n",
    "- **Monitor logs** for any errors or warnings from the AdMob SDK.\n",

    "### **Switching Between Test and Real Ads**\n",
